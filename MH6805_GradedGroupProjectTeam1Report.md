# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Machine Learning: A Comparative Analysis of Modern and Traditional Methods

## Abstract

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background & Motivation

Bitcoin, one of the most useful assets in the time of advanced technology and DeFi (Decentralized Finance), has been growing quickly in term of value in the international financial market. The inflow of capital from institutions and retailers has led companies like BlackRock to work on and roll out Bitcoin Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) in Europe. This is an important step, as it illustrates Bitcoin’s growing assimilation into the traditional financial system, which further expands the scope for traditional investors and alters the conventional approach toward the investment and management of cryptocurrencies.

The policy of the current US government is in the direction of enabling regular banking firms to participate actively in the markets, which marks a major change in financial policy. In trying to facilitate an underpinning of the regular banking system for digital assets like Bitcoin, the regulators are allowing greater market participation. Such a shift in regulatory attitude can foster greater acceptance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies among older financial systems that are often referred to as ‘legacy’ systems and do modern, digital focused economic systems.

But this revolution triggered by Bitcoin in the financial system has led institutions and brokerage firms to make massive investments in technologies and data analysis algorithms. It is in this context that the use of machine learning for the analysis and prediction of Bitcoin’s price has become essential to develop strategies and ensure better outcomes, such as minimizing risks.

For instance, research utilizing neural networks has been conducted to predict Bitcoin prices based on various economic, technological, and investor-related variables. These studies aim to identify the determinants of Bitcoin price formation and assess their stability over time, providing insights that can help steer discussions on regulatory approaches and risk assessment in the financial market. 

These developments highlight Bitcoin's increasing importance and integration into the financial market, driven by both institutional adoption and advancements in predictive analytics through machine learning.
Challenges of predicting Bitcoin prices due to high volatility and external factors (e.g., regulation, macroeconomics).
