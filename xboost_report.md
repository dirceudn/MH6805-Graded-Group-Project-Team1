# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This report outlines the methodology and approach for predicting Bitcoin (BTC) prices using machine learning techniques. The process involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The primary goal is to develop a robust model for predicting Bitcoin price trends using historical data and technical indicators.

## Data Preparation

### Loading the Data

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named `bitcoin_dataset.csv`. This dataset contains various price metrics and technical indicators for Bitcoin.
   - The `get_data_frame()` function uses `pandas.read_csv()` to load the data into a DataFrame.

### Preprocessing the Data

2. **Date Conversion**: The 'Date' column is converted to datetime format and set as the index to facilitate time series analysis.
   - The `convert_df_date_time()` function ensures that the data is sorted chronologically and indexed by date.

3. **Standardization**: The numerical features are standardized using z-score normalization to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.
   - The `get_df_standardized()` function uses `StandardScaler()` to normalize the features to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

## Feature Engineering

### Analyzing Feature Importance

4. **Feature Importance**: The importance of each feature is analyzed using a Random Forest classifier. This helps in identifying the most relevant features for predicting Bitcoin price trends.
   - The `analyze_feature_importance()` function fits a Random Forest model and calculates feature importances based on mean decrease impurity.

### Adding Technical Indicators

5. **Technical Indicators**: The dataset is enhanced with over 25 technical indicators to capture various aspects of price movements and market trends.
   - The `add_technical_indicators()` function calculates indicators such as Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), Momentum Indicators (RSI, ROC, MACD), Volatility Measures (Bollinger Bands), and Trend Indicators (ADX, Stochastic Oscillator).

## Data Preparation for Modeling

### Time-Series Sequences

6. **Time-Series Sequences**: The data is prepared for time-series modeling by creating sequences of historical time steps as features.
   - The `get_data_coordinates()` function generates sequences of a specified look-back period and prepares the data for modeling.

### Class Balancing

7. **Class Balancing**: The minority class is augmented using synthetic sample generation to balance the class distribution.
   - The `augment_minority_class()` function uses linear interpolation and noise injection to create synthetic samples for the minority class.

### Data Splitting

8. **Data Splitting**: The data is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
   - The `get_split_data_length()` and `get_train_values()` functions handle the data splitting and ensure that the training set is balanced.

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Flattening Time-Series Data

9. **Flattening Time-Series Data**: The 3D time-series data is flattened to 2D for compatibility with tree-based models like XGBoost.
   - The `flatten_time_series()` function reshapes the data to a 2D array.

### Training the Model

10. **Model Training**: An XGBoost classifier is trained on the prepared data using early stopping to prevent overfitting.
    - The `training_model()` function trains the XGBoost model and evaluates its performance on the validation and test sets.

### Evaluation Metrics

11. **Evaluation Metrics**: The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, AUC-ROC, F1 score, confusion matrix, and precision-recall analysis.
    - The `training_model()` function calculates these metrics and visualizes the confusion matrix and classification report.

### Optimal Threshold Calculation

12. **Optimal Threshold Calculation**: The optimal threshold for classifying positive and negative trends is calculated to maximize the F1 score.
    - The `training_model()` function determines the optimal threshold and evaluates the model's performance using this threshold.

## Conclusion

The XGBoost model provides a robust framework for predicting Bitcoin price trends. The use of technical indicators and feature engineering enhances the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data. Further improvements can be made by tuning the model parameters, incorporating additional features, or exploring other machine learning algorithms.
