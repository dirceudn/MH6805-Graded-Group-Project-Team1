# Bitcoin Price Prediction using ARIMA Model

## Overview

This report outlines the methodology and utilization of an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to predict Bitcoin (BTC) close prices using historical data. The process involves data preprocessing, scaling, visualization, and model training and evaluation. The primary goal is to develop a baseline model for predicting Bitcoin prices and compare it with other traditional and modern forecasting techniques.

## Research Objectives

The volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin, has intensified research into increasingly accurate price prediction models. While traditional statistical models have been used in the financial market, advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have introduced sophisticated alternatives. This study aims to:

1. Compare traditional methods (ARIMA, Random Walk) with more current models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and modified LSTM (mLSTM).
2. Analyze the impact of transaction segmentation on forecasting accuracy.
3. Implement a modern model using real data and extract insights from it.

## Data Preparation

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named `bitcoin_dataset.csv`. This dataset contains historical Bitcoin price data along with other relevant market indicators.

2. **Date Conversion**: The 'Date' column is converted to datetime format and set as the index for time series analysis. This step is crucial for ensuring that the data is correctly formatted for temporal analysis.

3. **Missing Values**: The code checks for missing values in the 'BTC Close' column to ensure data integrity before modeling. Missing values can introduce bias or errors in the model, so it's important to handle them appropriately.

## Data Visualization

- **Scaled Features**: The feature columns are scaled using Min-Max scaling to normalize the data between 0 and 1. This scaling helps in comparing different features on the same scale and is essential for many machine learning algorithms. A plot of the scaled values over time is generated to visualize trends and patterns in the data.

- **BTC Close Price**: A line plot of the Bitcoin close price over time is created to observe historical price movements. This visualization provides insights into the price fluctuations and helps in identifying any seasonality or trends.

## ARIMA Model

1. **Train/Test Split**: The data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. This split allows for training the model on a subset of the data and evaluating its performance on unseen data.

2. **Model Training**: An ARIMA(1,1,1) model is fitted to the training data. The order (p, d, q) of the ARIMA model can be adjusted based on model performance. The ARIMA model combines autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) to capture trends and seasonality in the data.

3. **Forecasting**: The model forecasts the test set, and the predictions are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE). MSE is a common metric for evaluating the accuracy of forecasting models.

4. **Visualization**: A plot comparing the actual vs. predicted BTC close prices is generated to visually assess model performance. This visualization helps in understanding how well the model captures the price movements.

## Literature Review

### Traditional Approaches to Bitcoin Price Prediction

- **ARIMA**: ARIMA models are widely used in time series forecasting. They combine autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) to model the data. ARIMA models are particularly useful for capturing trends and seasonality in time series data.

- **Random Walk Hypothesis (RWH)**: The RWH posits that asset prices follow unpredictable, independent movements. This hypothesis suggests that historical data cannot forecast future prices, and todayâ€™s price is the best predictor of tomorrowâ€™s. Studies have shown that Bitcoinâ€™s daily returns exhibit near-zero autocorrelation, supporting the RWH.

### Modern Approaches

- **LSTM and mLSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies. Modified LSTM (mLSTM) models build upon LSTM by incorporating additional features or modifications to improve forecasting accuracy.

## Conclusion

The ARIMA model provides a baseline for predicting Bitcoin close prices. While it captures linear trends and seasonality, further improvements can be made by tuning the ARIMA order, incorporating additional features, or exploring other time series forecasting models like LSTM. The comparison with modern models and the analysis of transaction segmentation can provide deeper insights into Bitcoin price prediction.

### Interpretation of the ARIMA Model Results for Bitcoin Price Prediction

#### **1. General Information**
- **Model Used:** ARIMA(1,1,1) (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **Number of Observations:** 2628 (Dates: 09-17-2014 to 11-26-2021)
- **Log Likelihood:** -21085.036
- **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion):** 42176.072
- **BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion):** 42193.692
- **HQIC (Hannan-Quinn Criterion):** 42182.453

AIC and BIC are model selection criteria. Lower values generally indicate a better fit, but they are primarily useful for comparing models rather than absolute quality assessment.

#### **2. Model Parameters**
- **AR(1) Coefficient (`ar.L1` = -0.6107)**  
  - This indicates that the previous day's Bitcoin price negatively impacts the current price (mean-reverting behavior).
  - A negative coefficient suggests a correctional movement in price trends.
  
- **MA(1) Coefficient (`ma.L1` = 0.5687)**  
  - This reflects short-term shock adjustments in Bitcoin's price.
  - A positive coefficient suggests that past errors (unexpected price movements) have a corrective effect on future prices.
  
- **SigmaÂ² (`sigma2` = 549,400)**  
  - This represents the variance of residuals (errors) in the model.
  - A high value suggests high volatility in Bitcoin prices.

#### **3. Model Diagnostics**
- **Ljung-Box Test (Q-Stat = 0.01, p-value = 0.90)**  
  - The high p-value (>0.05) suggests no significant autocorrelation in residuals, indicating that the model sufficiently captures dependencies.
  
- **Jarque-Bera Test (JB = 53611.48, p-value = 0.00)**  
  - The very low p-value (<0.05) indicates that residuals are not normally distributed.
  - High kurtosis (25.13) means there are extreme price fluctuations (fat-tailed distribution), a common feature in financial time series.

- **Heteroskedasticity (H = 5948.79, p-value = 0.00)**  
  - The high heteroskedasticity value indicates that price volatility is not constant over time.
  - This is expected in Bitcoin data, which experiences periods of high price swings.

#### **4. Model Performance**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE) = 717,954,450.58**  
  - A high MSE suggests significant prediction errors.
  - This could be due to Bitcoin's extreme volatility, which ARIMA models struggle to capture effectively.

### **Conclusion: Is ARIMA Suitable for Bitcoin Price Prediction?**
1. **Strengths:**
   - Captures short-term trends and autocorrelation in Bitcoin prices.
   - No significant autocorrelation in residuals, meaning the model is well-fitted to the given data.

2. **Weaknesses:**
   - High MSE indicates poor predictive accuracy, likely due to Bitcoin's non-stationary and highly volatile nature.
   - Residuals are not normally distributed, suggesting the model does not fully capture the complexity of Bitcoin's price movements.
   - The presence of high heteroskedasticity means the model struggles with periods of extreme price fluctuations.

3. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - **XGBoost or LSTM models** might perform better for Bitcoin price prediction as they can capture nonlinear patterns and complex dependencies in financial data.
   - **Hybrid models** (e.g., ARIMA + XGBoost) could leverage ARIMA for short-term linear trends and XGBoost for nonlinear relationships.

#### **Final Verdict:**  
While ARIMA provides a reasonable baseline model, its high MSE and inability to handle Bitcoinâ€™s volatility suggest that machine learning-based models like **XGBoost or LSTMs** would likely yield better predictive performance. ðŸš€
